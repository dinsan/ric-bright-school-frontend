# Lumina Frontend — TODO

Task list for the web app (`frontend/`). Written so a human or an AI agent can pick up one task at a time and finish it without extra context.

- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS 4, TanStack Query
- **Architecture:** feature-based. Routes in `src/app/` stay thin; logic lives in `src/features/<name>/` (`api`, `hooks`, `types`, `components`).
- **Backend counterpart:** `../backend/TODO.md` (task IDs like `BE-AUTH-06` refer to it)
- **Mobile app:** out of scope for now; Phase 16 prepares for it.

## How to use this file

**Task format**

```
- [ ] FE-EXAMPLE-00 · P0 · M — Title. Detail. (needs BE-AUTH-06)
      Done when: observable acceptance criteria.
```

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `P0` | Required for launch. Do first. |
| `P1` | Important, can follow launch. |
| `P2` | Nice to have / later. |
| `S` / `M` / `L` / `XL` | About half a day / 1–2 days / 3–5 days / more. Split any `L` or `XL` into smaller tasks before starting. |
| `needs BE-…` | Blocked until that backend task exists. Build against a mock (MSW) meanwhile. |

**Rules for whoever picks up a task** (human or AI)

1. Take the first unchecked task in the lowest-numbered phase whose dependencies are done. One task per pull request.
2. Keep `src/app/` thin. Put feature code in `src/features/<name>/`; put cross-feature UI in `src/components/`.
3. Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only where state, effects, or browser APIs are needed, and keep those components small.
4. Never call `fetch` directly in components. Use the API client in `src/lib/api-client.ts` through a feature `api.ts`, and TanStack Query hooks for client-side data.
5. Every screen needs four states designed and built: loading, empty, error, and success. Errors say what happened and what to do; they do not apologize.
6. Tick the checkbox in the same pull request that completes the task.

**Definition of done (applies to every task)**

- [ ] `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` pass
- [ ] Tests added for logic and for the main user flow (unit/component; end-to-end for critical flows)
- [ ] Keyboard-only use works, focus is visible, and there are no automated accessibility violations (axe)
- [ ] Works at 360 px wide up to desktop; no horizontal scrolling
- [ ] No hard-coded user-facing strings once i18n exists (FE-I18N-01)
- [ ] Reduced-motion preference respected for any animation

---

## Current state (already built)

- [x] Next.js app with TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind 4, ESLint, standalone Docker build
- [x] Design tokens (graph-paper background, ink and cobalt palette, sticker-style shadows, grade-band colours)
- [x] Layout: header, footer, providers (TanStack Query), not-found and error pages
- [x] API client with typed `ApiError` (maps the backend error envelope)
- [x] Landing page with the 12-tile grade picker
- [x] Courses page: filter by grade, subject, title; pagination; state kept in the URL; loading, empty, and error states
- [x] Course detail page (server-rendered, revalidated every 60 seconds, per-course metadata)
- [x] UI primitives: `Button`, `ButtonLink`, `Skeleton`

---

## Phase 0 — Gaps in the initial scaffold

- [x] FE-FIX-01 · P0 · S — Look at every page in a real browser at 360, 768, and 1280 px and fix what is off. The scaffold was verified by build and HTTP checks only, not visually.
      Done when: screenshots of home, courses, and course detail at three widths are reviewed and any layout issues are fixed.
- [ ] FE-FIX-02 · P0 · S — Verify the Docker image builds and runs with the Compose stack (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` build argument, `API_URL` at runtime).
      Status: Compose file fixed for this repo and the Dockerfile stages replayed without Docker (clean context, `npm ci`, build, standalone server with runtime `API_URL`): all pass. Tick after the first successful `docker compose up --build` on a machine with Docker.
- [x] FE-FIX-03 · P0 · S — Add `loading.tsx` for `/courses/[slug]` and make `error.tsx` report the error (currently the error parameter is unused).
      Note: the skeleton streams on direct loads. On client-side navigation Next.js waits for `generateMetadata` (which fetches the course) before showing it, so with a slow API the previous page stays until the course arrives. Revisit with partial prefetching / Cache Components.
- [x] FE-FIX-04 · P1 · S — Replace the hand-written `cn` with `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` so class overrides behave predictably.
- [x] FE-FIX-05 · P1 · S — Footer uses `new Date()` during render; make sure it does not cause a hydration or caching surprise (render the year at build time or on the client).
- [x] FE-FIX-06 · P1 · S — The course search input is uncontrolled and keeps its own text when filters are cleared. Reset it when the URL query is cleared.
- [x] FE-FIX-07 · P1 · S — Pagination: scroll to the top of the results after the page changes, and move focus to the results heading for screen reader users.
- [x] FE-FIX-08 · P2 · S — Use a real web font (self-hosted via `next/font`) instead of the system font stack; pick one with good legibility for young readers.

## Phase 1 — Engineering foundation

- [ ] FE-OPS-01 · P0 · M — CI (GitHub Actions): install with cache, lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, and end-to-end tests against a preview stack.
- [ ] FE-OPS-02 · P0 · S — Prettier with the Tailwind class-sorting plugin; pre-commit hook (`lint-staged` + `husky` or `lefthook`).
- [ ] FE-OPS-03 · P0 · M — Unit and component testing: Vitest + React Testing Library + `jest-dom`. Cover `url-state`, `api-client`, `CoursesBrowser`, `src/lib/forms` (messages, server error mapping) and the design-system components per `docs/component-test-plan.md` (FE-DS-11).
- [ ] FE-OPS-04 · P0 · M — End-to-end tests with Playwright: home → pick grade → course list → course detail, and the account flows listed under Testing in `docs/auth.md` (with MSW, FE-OPS-05). Run in CI with traces on failure.
- [ ] FE-OPS-05 · P0 · M — API mocking with MSW for tests and for developing against unfinished backend tasks.
- [ ] FE-OPS-06 · P1 · S — Dependabot or Renovate; `npm audit` in CI.
- [ ] FE-OPS-07 · P1 · M — Storybook (or Ladle) for UI primitives, with the accessibility addon.
- [ ] FE-OPS-08 · P1 · S — Bundle analysis script and a size budget in CI.
- [ ] FE-API-01 · P0 · M — Generate TypeScript types from the backend `/openapi.json` (`openapi-typescript`) and delete the hand-written types in `features/catalog/types.ts`. (needs X-01)
- [ ] FE-API-02 · P0 · S — Validate environment variables at startup with `zod` (fail the build when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is missing in production).
- [ ] FE-API-03 · P1 · M — Request ID propagation: read `X-Request-ID` from errors and show it in a "copy error details" action for support.
- [ ] FE-API-04 · P1 · M — Query key factory and cache invalidation conventions for every feature (extend the `catalogKeys` pattern); prefetch + hydrate on the server for the main list pages.
- [ ] FE-API-05 · P1 · S — Global handling for `401` (try refresh once, then redirect to sign-in) and `429` (show a friendly retry message). (needs BE-AUTH-06, BE-CORE-04)
      Partly done: 401 is handled globally (the gateway refreshes once; if the session really ended, sign in and come back). 429 is explained in forms; still needed for non-form requests.

---

## Phase 2 — Design system

Build the shared building blocks once so later features stay consistent. Use headless primitives (Radix UI or React Aria) for accessibility instead of writing dialogs and menus from scratch.

- [x] FE-DS-01 · P0 · M — Formalize design tokens: colors (with contrast ratios checked), type scale, spacing, radius, shadow, z-index, motion. Document in Storybook or `docs/design.md`.
- [x] FE-DS-02 · P0 · L — Core components: `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch`, `Label`, `FormField` (with error and hint), `Badge`, `Card`, `Avatar`, `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Dialog`, `Sheet` (mobile drawer), `DropdownMenu`, `Toast`, `Alert`, `Progress`, `Spinner`, `Breadcrumb`, `Pagination`.
- [x] FE-DS-03 · P0 · M — Forms: `react-hook-form` + `zod` resolvers, shared validation messages, server error mapping from the API's `details` array to fields.
- [x] FE-DS-04 · P0 · M — Layouts: marketing layout, app layout with sidebar (student, teacher, parent, admin variants), and a focused layout for lessons and quizzes with no distractions.
- [x] FE-DS-05 · P1 · M — Dark mode and a high-contrast theme, switchable and remembered, with no flash on load.
- [x] FE-DS-06 · P1 · M — Age-appropriate presentation: a younger variant (Grades 1–5: larger type, larger targets, more color, more illustration) and an older one (Grades 9–12: denser, calmer). Controlled by a single "grade band" theme switch from the student profile.
- [x] FE-DS-07 · P1 · M — Illustration and icon system (one consistent icon set; SVG sprite or `lucide-react`), empty-state illustrations.
- [x] FE-DS-08 · P2 · M — Motion guidelines and a small set of reusable animations (celebration on completion, progress fill). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] FE-DS-09 · P2 · S — Sound effects toggle for young learners (off by default).

### Design system review: findings

Every component was exercised in Chromium in several configurations (controlled and uncontrolled, disabled, error, nested overlays, edge values), by mouse and keyboard, in all themes and grade bands. The scenarios are listed in `docs/component-test-plan.md`.

- [x] FE-DS-10 · P0 · M — Component verification review. Fixed: `Button asChild` ignored `disabled`/`loading` (links stayed clickable); Pagination dropped keyboard focus to the page on the last page; toasts stopped auto-dismissing after one was dismissed with the mouse (Radix pause never reset); toasts could fill the screen (now at most 3); theme and band changes were lost when storage is blocked; OS dark-mode and other-tab changes were ignored on pages without a theme switcher; the mobile drawer stayed open after resizing to desktop; `?page=99` on Courses said "No courses yet"; `Select` had no placeholder (forms built their own, inconsistently); `Avatar` had no decorative mode; the browser `theme-color` ignored the chosen theme.
- [ ] FE-DS-11 · P0 · M — Automate `docs/component-test-plan.md`: component tests (with FE-OPS-03) and browser flows (with FE-OPS-04). Lines marked **R** are fixed bugs and need regression tests first.
      Done when: every line of the plan has a test in CI.
- [ ] FE-DS-12 · P1 · S — `ConfirmDialog` on Radix AlertDialog for destructive or exit actions (delete, leave quiz): `role="alertdialog"`, no close on scrim click, focus starts on the safe action. Today those use the plain `Dialog`, whose first focus is the Close button.
- [ ] FE-DS-13 · P1 · S — Consistent field APIs: RadioGroup needs the field name twice with react-hook-form (`name` on the group for the error and `register` on each radio) — take it once; add `disabled` and `required` to RadioGroup; add `error` to Switch (Checkbox has it). Keep the `FormField` / `withFormError` pattern for all.
- [ ] FE-DS-14 · P1 · M — Toast API: `toast.dismiss(id)` and `toast.update(id)`, and an optional single action (for example "Undo") that also has a keyboard path. Today toasts can only be created.
- [ ] FE-DS-15 · P1 · S — Checkbox `indeterminate` state (select-all in rosters and the gradebook, FE-TCH-06/08).
- [ ] FE-DS-16 · P1 · M — Long forms: an error summary that lists every field error with links to the fields (shown on submit), and an "unsaved changes" warning when leaving a page or closing a dialog with edited fields.
- [ ] FE-DS-17 · P2 · S — `NumberInput` for answers and ages: `type="number"` changes value on mouse-wheel and accepts `e`, `+` and `-`; use a text input with `inputMode="numeric"` and a pattern instead.
- [ ] FE-DS-18 · P2 · S — Textarea character counter linked to the schema's maximum, announced politely near the limit.
- [ ] FE-DS-19 · P2 · S — Tooltip limits: tooltips cannot open on disabled buttons (no pointer events) and Radix closes them on scroll. Document the pattern (aria-disabled button, or the reason as visible text) and add it to `/design`.
- [ ] FE-DS-20 · P2 · M — Primitives the coming phases need, built the same way (tokens, Radix where interactive, added to `/design` and the test plan): Popover, Accordion, Combobox (searchable select), DatePicker (due dates), FileUpload (media library), Slider, DataTable (gradebook), DropdownMenu submenus, indeterminate Progress.
- [ ] FE-DS-21 · P2 · S — Localisation and right-to-left readiness: component strings are hard-coded English ("Close", "Dismiss", "Previous page", "(optional)", "Skip to main content", "Open menu", "Notifications") — move them to the i18n catalogue with FE-I18N-01. Sheet sides, the switch thumb, the select chevron and breadcrumb chevrons use physical left/right; switch to logical properties if an RTL language is planned.
- [ ] FE-DS-22 · P2 · S — Radix Toast workaround (`src/components/ui/toast.tsx`, provider remount): re-check on every Radix upgrade and remove once the pause is reset upstream.

---

## Phase 3 — Authentication and accounts

Connected to the backend's accounts endpoints; see `docs/auth.md`. The request/response shapes were not available and are assumed in `src/features/auth/contract.ts` (FE-AUTH-11).

- [ ] FE-AUTH-11 · P0 · S — Confirm the accounts contract with the backend: check the 12-point checklist in `docs/auth.md` against `/openapi.json`, fix `src/features/auth/contract.ts`, and get the classroom sign-in endpoints (class roster, picture sign-in) confirmed or added. Then generate the types (FE-API-01).
      Done when: every `ASSUMED` in the contract is confirmed or corrected, and the sign-in flows pass against the real backend.

- [x] FE-AUTH-01 · P0 · L — Auth session handling per the transport chosen in X-02 (httpOnly cookies recommended). Server-side session read in layouts, `useSession` on the client, silent refresh. (needs BE-AUTH-06)
      Done: BFF gateway with httpOnly cookies (X-02), server-side session in layouts (`requireUser`), `useSession`, refresh in the proxy and the gateway; outages never sign people out.
- [x] FE-AUTH-02 · P0 · M — Pages: sign up (with role choice), sign in, sign out, forgot password, reset password, verify email. Clear, specific error messages; no hint about whether an email exists. (needs BE-AUTH-06, BE-AUTH-07)
      Done: /sign-up (parent or teacher), /sign-in (+ MFA step), sign out, /forgot-password (no enumeration), /reset-password, /verify-email (+ resend), /confirm-email.
- [x] FE-AUTH-03 · P0 · M — Route protection with `middleware.ts` or layout guards; redirect back to the original page after sign-in; role-aware redirects after login.
      Done: `src/proxy.ts` + `(app)` layout guards, `?next=` back to the page (same-site only), role homes, wrong-role areas redirect home.
- [x] FE-AUTH-04 · P0 · M — Role-aware navigation (student, parent, teacher, admin) and a user menu.
      Done: per-role sidebar (only built pages shown), account menu with Account settings, Display settings, Sign out.
- [x] FE-AUTH-05 · P1 · M — Parent flows: add a child, link a child with a code, child switcher in the header. (needs BE-USERS-02)
      Done: add a child (with consent), link with the code a student makes, child switcher in the top bar, choose the child's sign-in (password or pictures).
- [x] FE-AUTH-06 · P1 · M — Child-friendly sign-in for Grades 1–3: class code, username, picture password. (needs BE-AUTH-10)
      Done against ASSUMED endpoints (FE-AUTH-11): /sign-in/class (class code, remembered on classroom devices, name, 3 pictures, lockout message) and /sign-in/student.
- [ ] FE-AUTH-07 · P1 · M — Parental consent screens for children under the age limit (explain clearly, in plain language). (needs BE-SEC-04)
      Partly done: a parent adding a child confirms they are the parent or guardian and agrees for the child (`parental_consent`). Still needed: consent requests sent to a parent when a school or teacher creates the account, once BE-SEC-04 defines them.
- [x] FE-AUTH-08 · P1 · M — Social sign-in buttons (Google, Microsoft, Apple). (needs BE-AUTH-11)
      Done: providers from `/auth/oauth/providers`, sign-in/sign-up and account linking/unlinking through `/auth/callback`.
- [ ] FE-AUTH-09 · P1 · M — Account settings: profile, change password, change email, language, time zone, notification preferences, active sessions, delete account and export my data. (needs BE-USERS-01, BE-SEC-05)
      Mostly done (/account, /account/security): profile, password, email change, language, time zone, active sessions, linked accounts, delete account. Still needed (no endpoints yet): notification preferences and "export my data".
- [x] FE-AUTH-10 · P2 · S — Two-factor setup screens for teachers and admins. (needs BE-AUTH-12)
      Done for every adult account: TOTP setup with a QR code drawn locally, recovery codes (shown once, download), regenerate, turn off; sign-in step accepts recovery codes.

---

## Phase 4 — Public site and discovery

- [ ] FE-PUB-01 · P0 · M — Improve the landing page after real content exists: how it works, what a lesson looks like (live interactive preview), subject overview, teacher and parent sections, FAQ. Keep the grade picker as the first thing a visitor sees.
- [ ] FE-PUB-02 · P0 · M — SEO: sitemap, robots, canonical URLs, Open Graph and Twitter images per course, JSON-LD (`Course`), and meaningful `<title>` and descriptions.
- [ ] FE-PUB-03 · P0 · M — Dedicated pages per grade (`/grades/4`) and per subject (`/subjects/mathematics`), statically generated with revalidation; these are the main organic entry points.
- [ ] FE-PUB-04 · P0 · M — Legal and trust pages: privacy policy (with a child-friendly summary), terms, cookie policy, safety for children, contact. Content from legal review.
- [ ] FE-PUB-05 · P1 · M — Course detail upgrade: syllabus (units and lessons), prerequisites, standards covered, estimated time, preview lesson, enrol button, related courses. (needs BE-CAT-01, BE-CAT-05)
- [ ] FE-PUB-06 · P1 · M — Global search with instant results (command palette style) across courses and lessons. (needs BE-CAT-07)
- [ ] FE-PUB-07 · P1 · M — Pricing page and plan comparison. (needs BE-BILL-01)

- [ ] FE-STU-03 · P0 · XL — Lesson player (the core product). Split into: layout and navigation (previous/next, outline sidebar, mobile drawer); content block renderers (text, image, video, file, embed, interactive); completion handling with optimistic updates; resume where you left off. (needs BE-CAT-02, BE-LRN-02)
- [ ] FE-STU-04 · P0 · M — Video player: HLS playback, captions, speed, keyboard controls, remembers position, poster and loading states. (needs BE-MEDIA-03)
- [ ] FE-STU-05 · P0 · M — Progress sync that survives poor connections: queue updates locally and retry, de-duplicate, show a quiet "saved" indicator. (needs BE-LRN-02)
- [ ] FE-STU-06 · P1 · M — Notes and bookmarks inside lessons. (needs BE-LRN-04)
- [ ] FE-STU-07 · P1 · M — Gamification UI: streak flame, XP bar, badges shelf, level-up moment, celebration on completing a lesson or course. Optional and quieter for older grades. (needs BE-LRN-05)
- [ ] FE-STU-08 · P1 · M — Certificates page and download. (needs BE-LRN-06)
- [ ] FE-STU-09 · P1 · M — Learning path view for a grade and subject: what is done, what is next, what is locked and why. (needs BE-CAT-08)
- [ ] FE-STU-10 · P2 · M — Review queue and practice mode. (needs BE-LRN-08, BE-ASM-08)

---

## Phase 6 — Assessments UI

- [ ] FE-ASM-01 · P0 · L — Quiz player: one question at a time or all on one page (configurable), question navigator, flag for review, autosave, server-driven timer with a clear but calm countdown, submit confirmation. (needs BE-ASM-03)
- [ ] FE-ASM-02 · P0 · L — Answer inputs for each question type: multiple choice, multi-select, true/false, short answer, numeric, fill-in-the-blank, matching, ordering (drag and keyboard accessible), open response. (needs BE-ASM-01)
- [ ] FE-ASM-03 · P0 · M — Math input and display: LaTeX rendering (KaTeX) and an accessible equation editor for answers (MathLive or similar).

- [ ] FE-TCH-07 · P0 · M — Assign work to a class or to selected students with due dates; track completion per student. (needs BE-SCH-03)
- [ ] FE-TCH-08 · P0 · L — Gradebook table (sortable, filterable, keyboard navigable, handles hundreds of rows with virtualization), with CSV export. (needs BE-SCH-04)
- [ ] FE-TCH-09 · P1 · M — Grading queue for open responses with rubric, feedback, and shortcuts for speed. (needs BE-ASM-05)

- [ ] FE-BILL-04 · P2 · M — School license request and quote flow. (needs BE-BILL-04)

---

## Phase 13 — Accessibility (ongoing, but schedule dedicated time)

Target: WCAG 2.2 AA. Students include children and learners with disabilities; this is a core requirement, not polish.

- [ ] FE-A11Y-01 · P0 · S — Add `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` rules (already partly included in Next's config; review) and `axe` checks in component and end-to-end tests.
- [ ] FE-A11Y-02 · P0 · M — Skip link, landmark structure, heading order, page title announcements on navigation, and focus management on route change.
- [ ] FE-A11Y-03 · P0 · M — Full keyboard operation of every interactive piece (drag-and-drop alternatives, quiz navigator, video controls, menus).
- [ ] FE-A11Y-04 · P0 · M — Screen reader pass (NVDA, VoiceOver) on the main flows: sign-in, find a course, take a lesson, take a quiz. Fix findings.
- [ ] FE-A11Y-05 · P1 · M — Reading support: dyslexia-friendly font option, adjustable text size and spacing, optional read-aloud for text blocks.
- [ ] FE-A11Y-06 · P1 · S — Color contrast audit for every theme, including grade-band colors (yellow on white fails; check the marker color usage).
- [ ] FE-A11Y-07 · P1 · S — Captions and transcripts always available for video; warn authors when missing.
- [ ] FE-A11Y-08 · P2 · M — Independent accessibility audit before public launch.

## Phase 14 — Internationalization

- [ ] FE-I18N-01 · P1 · L — Introduce `next-intl` (or equivalent): locale routing, message catalogs, pluralization, date/number formatting. Move all user-facing strings out of components. Do this early; retrofitting is expensive.
- [ ] FE-I18N-02 · P1 · M — Language switcher; remember the choice in the profile and a cookie.
- [ ] FE-I18N-03 · P2 · M — Right-to-left layout support (use logical CSS properties: `ms-*`, `ps-*`).
- [ ] FE-I18N-04 · P2 · M — Localized content from the API (`Accept-Language`); localized SEO (`hreflang`). (needs BE-CAT-09)

---

## Phase 15 — Performance and quality

- [ ] FE-PERF-01 · P0 · M — Core Web Vitals budget (LCP < 2.5 s, INP < 200 ms, CLS < 0.1) on mid-range phones over a slow network. Lighthouse CI on key pages.
- [ ] FE-PERF-02 · P0 · M — Image handling with `next/image`, responsive sizes, modern formats, and a CDN loader.
- [ ] FE-PERF-03 · P1 · M — Caching strategy: static + revalidate for public pages; `revalidateTag` on content publish through a signed webhook from the backend.
- [ ] FE-PERF-04 · P1 · M — Route-level code splitting for heavy features (editor, video player, charts); lazy load below-the-fold widgets.
- [ ] FE-PERF-05 · P1 · M — Real-user monitoring (Web Vitals reporting) and error tracking (Sentry) with source maps. Do not send personal data about children.
- [ ] FE-PERF-06 · P1 · S — Make heavy tables and lists virtualized (gradebook, rosters, question bank).
- [ ] FE-QA-01 · P1 · M — Visual regression tests for key components and pages (Playwright screenshots or Chromatic).
- [ ] FE-QA-02 · P1 · M — Cross-browser and device matrix (Chrome, Safari including iOS, Firefox, low-end Android, school-issued Chromebooks).
- [ ] FE-QA-03 · P2 · M — Test with network throttling and offline conditions; verify graceful behavior.

## Phase 16 — Offline, PWA, and mobile preparation

- [ ] FE-PWA-01 · P2 · M — Web app manifest and install prompt; app icons.
- [ ] FE-PWA-02 · P2 · L — Service worker: cache app shell and downloaded lessons; offline-safe progress queue (shares logic with FE-STU-05). (needs BE-MOB-02)
- [ ] FE-MOB-01 · P1 · L — Convert to a workspace monorepo (`apps/web`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/*`) before the mobile app starts. Extract shared `api-client`, generated API types, validation schemas, and design tokens into packages.
- [ ] FE-MOB-02 · P1 · M — Keep business logic (hooks, state, formatters) free of DOM and Next.js imports so React Native can reuse it.
- [ ] FE-MOB-03 · P2 · M — Deep link scheme and universal links plan (`/courses/[slug]`, `/lessons/[id]`).

---

## Phase 17 — Security and privacy (frontend side)

- [ ] FE-SEC-01 · P0 · M — Content Security Policy (nonce-based), plus the headers already set in `next.config.ts` (add HSTS, Permissions-Policy). Test that embeds and video still work.
- [ ] FE-SEC-02 · P0 · M — Sanitize all rendered rich content (DOMPurify or server-side sanitization); never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without it. Add a test with malicious payloads.
- [x] FE-SEC-03 · P0 · S — Keep tokens out of `localStorage`. Follow the transport decision in X-02; protect state-changing requests against CSRF if cookies are used.
      Done: tokens only in httpOnly cookies set by this app; CSRF: SameSite=Lax + Origin check + app header on every state-changing request; forms POST so early submits never put passwords in URLs.
- [ ] FE-SEC-04 · P0 · M — Third-party scripts policy for a children's product: no ad or tracking scripts, analytics only with consent, self-host where possible, review each addition.
- [ ] FE-SEC-05 · P1 · S — Dependency review: pin versions, run `npm audit` and license checks in CI.
- [ ] FE-SEC-06 · P1 · S — Do not render or log personal data of children in client error reports or analytics.

---

## Phase 18 — Deployment

- [ ] FE-DEP-01 · P0 · M — Choose hosting (Vercel or containers on the same platform as the API) and set up preview deployments for every pull request.
- [ ] FE-DEP-02 · P0 · M — Environments (preview, staging, production) with their own environment variables; no secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
- [ ] FE-DEP-03 · P1 · S — Custom domain, HTTPS, redirects (www, trailing slash), and a maintenance page.
- [ ] FE-DEP-04 · P1 · M — Feature flags on the client (matching the backend choice, BE-INFRA-05) for gradual rollouts.
- [ ] FE-DEP-05 · P1 · S — Release process: versioning, changelog, and rollback steps in `docs/release.md`.

---

## Cross-project contracts (keep in sync with `../backend/TODO.md`)

- [ ] X-01 · P0 · S — Backend publishes OpenAPI; this app generates types from it (FE-API-01).
- [x] X-02 · P0 · M — Decide browser auth transport (cookies vs bearer) and record it in an ADR. It decides FE-AUTH-01 and FE-SEC-03.
      Decided: backend-for-frontend with httpOnly cookies (docs/auth.md).
- [ ] X-03 · P0 · S — Error envelope codes and validation `details` shape are documented; form components map `details[].field` to inputs.
- [ ] X-04 · P1 · S — CORS and cookie settings per environment.
- [ ] X-05 · P1 · M — Signed revalidation webhook from backend to frontend on content publish (FE-PERF-03).

## Suggested order for a first public launch

1. Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 (fixes, tooling, design system)
2. Phase 3 (accounts), in step with backend Phase 2
3. Phase 4 (public site, SEO) → Phase 5 (student lessons) → Phase 6 (quizzes)
4. Phase 7 (teacher authoring and gradebook) → Phase 8 (parents)
5. Phase 13 (accessibility), 15 (performance), 17 (security), 18 (deployment): start early, finish before launch
6. Soft launch with a few schools → then Phases 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 → later Phase 11
